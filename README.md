Testing python

This is a repository to test out Github as well and share what I've done in Python.

GraphingExample are three graphs created from the Seaborn module using NFL data that is labeled week1.csv.

TeradataExample is testing the connection to Teradata using the Teradata module, pulling tables and information
using the pd.read_sql function from Pandas, and then graphing the data we've taken from the tables.
